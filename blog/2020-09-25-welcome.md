I am happy to share a project I have been working on for a while now: a reactive
framework for building beautiful cross-platform user interfaces in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) ðŸ¦€.

<!--truncate-->

Polyhorn consists of two libraries: a core library that is similar in purpose
to React (without the DOM renderer) and platform libraries that are similar
in purpose to React Native (but limited to a single platform each).

Additionally, we provide a CLI that does all the magic âœ¨ of setting up your
project.

You can run your first Rust-powered iOS app in 2 minutes:

```bash
# Install Rust if you haven't already.
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install the Polyhorn CLI using the Rust package manager.
cargo install polyhorn

# Create your first Polyhorn project.
polyhorn new example

# Run your project in the iOS simulator.
cd example; polyhorn run ios
```

On this site, you will find [general documentation](/docs/) ðŸ“–, an [API reference](/api/) ðŸ“• and documentation on [built-in components](/components/) ðŸ§±.

We also provide two plugins ðŸ”Œ for commonly used tasks:
[animation with Yoyo](/plugins/yoyo/) ðŸª€ (inspired by the
magnificent [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion/) library) and
[navigation with Taxi](/plugins/taxi/) ðŸš• (inspired by [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)).

Finally, keep in mind that this is still a Preview ðŸš§, expect some changes
here and there. If you would like to get involved (which I would really
appreciate), please check out [our Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/polyhorn) ðŸ“¡
or post a message at [our Github](https://github.com/polyhorn/polyhorn) ðŸ› .

Thanks for reading!

Tim
